      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-900">Streamlining Operations</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Manufacturing businesses are complex entities with numerous moving parts. From inventory management to 
        production scheduling, every detail needs to be meticulously managed. An ERP system like ERPNext integrates 
        all these functions into a single platform, ensuring that data flows seamlessly across departments. 
        This integration reduces errors, improves communication, and helps in making informed decisions.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-green-900">Enhancing Efficiency</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Efficiency is the name of the game in manufacturing. With ERPNext, tasks that once took hours can be completed in minutes. 
        Automation of routine tasks such as order processing, inventory tracking, and report generation frees up your staff 
        to focus on more strategic activities. The result? Increased productivity and a significant boost to your bottom line.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-yellow-900">Real-Time Data Access</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        In manufacturing, timely access to accurate data is critical. ERPNext provides real-time data access, allowing you to 
        monitor production processes, track inventory levels, and respond swiftly to any issues that arise. This real-time 
        visibility helps in maintaining high operational standards and minimizing downtime.

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-500">Key Features of ERPNext for Manufacturing</h1>
    
    <div class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Inventory Management</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        One of the standout features of ERPNext is its robust inventory management capabilities. 
        It allows you to keep track of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods with ease. 
        Automated reordering ensures you never run out of critical components, and detailed inventory 
        reports help in optimizing stock levels.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Production Planning</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        ERPNext excels in production planning and scheduling. It enables you to create detailed production 
        plans, allocate resources efficiently, and monitor progress in real time. This leads to better utilization 
        of resources, reduced production costs, and timely delivery of products.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Quality Control</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Maintaining high-quality standards is paramount in manufacturing. ERPNext's quality control module helps you 
        implement stringent quality checks at various stages of production. This ensures that only products meeting your 
        quality standards reach the market, enhancing customer satisfaction and brand reputation.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Cost Management</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Keeping a tight grip on costs is essential for profitability. ERPNext provides detailed cost tracking and analysis, 
        helping you identify areas where savings can be made. By analyzing production costs, overheads, and other expenses, 
        you can make data-driven decisions to improve profitability.
